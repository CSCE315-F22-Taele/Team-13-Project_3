Summarize discussion  in paragraph form from the previous meeting (NOT this current meeting).

Tommy will go through BYO buttons and add functionality. Emily will look into postgres queries and databse connection. Conner will work on styling and other front-end.
Jerry will be out of town this weekend but has already implemented page movement and the barebones structure of the program. The goal for this deliverable is to get
